##IOPâ€™s Ansible Playbooks

This repository contains a set of Ansible playbooks we're evolving for managing user creation and workstation maintenence at [Ideas On Purpose][iop]. While these tasks are very specific to our needs, there's likely something here which will be helpful towards other goals.

This started out as a basic recipe to eliminate some of the repetitive drudgery of creating and setting up accounts, but it's becoming more of a general toolkit for all sorts of repetitive tasks.

Below are excessively complete instructions for setting up the controller and running the playbooks. Partly in case I forget, partly so I can ask someone else to do this for me.

### The Playbooks

There are two main playbooks:

* **user.yml**
    Sets up the new user account and a bunch of default settings. These are primarily used by designers. 

* **admin.yml**
    Sets up an admin account on the target computer with some of my preferred settings and tools. This can also be used to reset an admin account back to a clean state.

### Initial Setup
Pre-run steps are annoying. I've tried mightily to get around these, but it seems like it's just easier to suck it up and deal with a little bit of manual configuration.

#### Target computer pre-run setup
The target playbooks are only tested against Mavericks.

1. Setup a plain administrator account, Ansible will configure other accounts through this one. The `admin.yml` playbook will flesh out this account.
2. Turn on **Remote Login** in **System Preferences** > **Sharing**. (This enables ssh)
3. Install [XCode from the Mac App Store][xcode appstore]. Open Xcode, agree to the license agreement and let it finish installing. The installation should include the XCode Command Line Tools.

#### Controller Setup

This should be every step necessary to set up a clean Mavericks system to run the playbooks. This should only need to be done once.

1. Install [Xcode from the Mac App Store][xcode appstore]
2. Install [Homebrew][]
3. `brew install ansible multimarkdown ssh-copy-id`
6. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ideasonpurpose/ansible-playbooks.git`
7. `cd ansible-playbooks`
8. Install from the `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the playbooks

These first steps make sure the controller can talk to the target and execute commands. 

#### First run 

1. Rename the `hosts_sample` document to `hosts` and enter the addresses of your target machines and the name of the admin user.
2. Copy your SSH public key to the target:  
    `ssh-copy-id admin@target-imac.local`
3. Copy the `bootstrap.sh` script to the target machine. SSH into the target and run the ruby script with sudo to configure the target's sudoers file.

```
$ ssh-copy-id admin@imac-2.local
$ scp bootstrap.rb admin@imac-2.local:
$ ssh admin@imac-2.local
imac-1.local$ sudo ruby bootstrap.rb
imac-1.local$ logout
```
#### Account setup
1. Copy `vars/user_sample.yml` to `vars/user.yml` and update the user credentials
2. Configure the admin account:  
    `ansible-playbook admin.yml --extra-vars "target=imac-2.local"`
3. Create and set up the user account:  
    `ansible-playbook user.yml --extra-vars "target=imac-2.local"`


## Additional Notes


### The hosts file

Hosts is simply an INI file listing known computers. It should look something like this:

    # file: hosts
    [imacs:vars]
    admin_user=macadmin
    
    [imacs]
    imac-1.local
    imac-2.local

Ansible will ignore computers that do not appear in hosts.

The `:vars` section is used to define `admin_user` which should be an account which can run sudo commands.

### Targeting a single machine
Because these playbooks are potentially destructive, `hosts:` is declared with the `{{ target }}` variable. This way, the playbooks default to doing nothing instead of running on every machine in the office. Explicit wins.

A command targeted to one machine looks like this:

    $ ansible-playbook user.yml --extra-vars "target=imac-2.local"

The group could be just as easily targeted with `--extra-vars "target=imacs"` to create the user account on each computer

### Bootstrapping the first run

The `bootstrap.rb` script sets up ssh keys and adds the admin user to `sudoers`. This is necessary for playbooks to run without password prompts.

### Running Locally
The playbooks can also be run locally by targeting localhost and setting connection to local:
    
    $ ansible-playbook user.yml --extra-vars "target=localhost" --connection=local

### User account images
The playbooks will randomly select a user image from any png images found in `files/admin_account_images` or `files/user_account_images`. If no images are found, the accounts will be created using the system placeholder image. 

### Admin accounts
Don't name your admin account `admin`. That's one of the first names automated attacks will try to connect to.

## Warning
Assuming you've gone so far as to get Ansible running and have downloaded these playbooks, you probably understand how this stuff works and how much damage it could do. But just in case, **These playbooks will remove data, destroy accounts and wreak havok if pointed to the wrong account.** Please be careful, keep backups and read the code before running it.

### Tasks
Here are a few of the things these playbooks accomplish:

* Configure an admin user account
* Set a default Dock (using a stripped down template plist)
* Set preferences in Finder and Safari to our preferred defaults (see [osx dotfiles][dotfiles])
* Reset Safari
* Reset admin account picture and desktop pattern
* Install [Homebrew][] and several packages from Homebrew
* Install [Homebrew Cask][cask] and several common applications via Cask.
* Install modules with pip (from homebrew's /usr/local/bin)
* Modify default terminal settings
* Generate a pre-formatted email signature
* Generate a custom HTML welcome document
